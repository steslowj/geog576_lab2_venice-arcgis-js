# geog576_lab2
A repo for UW-Mad Geog 576 Lab 2

## Project Summary
This project is a web map using ArcGIS Online JavaScript code to create a web-map with JavaScript and various hosted datasources.
My map is a look at Venice, Italy, with:
<ul>
  <li>Basemap & basemap gallery provided by ESRI</li>
  <li>Polygon features for Sestieri (neighborhoods) drawn by me (rough estimate using Wikipedia and existing land data), using ArcGIS Online REST URL</li>
  <li>Point features for tourist attractions created and styled by <a href = "https://uw-mad.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f3dcc26dd868456da288baca83b8a2cd">Open Street Maps</a>, using ArcGIS Online REST URL.</li>
  <li>Point features for coffee shops and gardens styled by <a href="https://uw-mad.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9824340cdac14822b38725e4babc7b55">me</a>, based off Google Search results, also using REST.</li>
</ul>
